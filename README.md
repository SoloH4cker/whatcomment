WhatComment. This is the most first version(v1.0) of the tool so there are limited features only. This tool can test for hidden email address, JS Files, Admin Panel/URLs in the code comments. I have some big plans to improve this tool further and add many more features such as API Keys, tokens, credentials, other secret and sensitive information, etc. which will be added in upcoming updates.
You can use this tool for your next penetration testing project and also for Bug Bounty! Who knows you might get some of your easiest catch ever and make some profit!ü§ë
If you want to become part of this and have some good suggestion or want to some features then you are free to commit!!! Improving this tool as much as possible is only our GOAL!
